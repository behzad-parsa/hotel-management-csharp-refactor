## Description
The first version of the hotel system was written in my college days in 2018. Recently,I decided to refactor my code in a different style and architecture, with efficient and clean code in a new repository with separate commits. The older version is available on my repo [here](https://github.com/behzad-parsa/hotel-management-csharp).

The idea is simple: we have 2 main **Actors** (customers and users) in the Database, who impact the program, and our main challenge is to manage **the flow of data** based on these actors.Â  

 - **Users** : They are the end users who are **Employees** either and register the data

 - **Customers** : They're going to be our direct clients,and they can have attendance, which is knowns as **Guests** in the Database

The program is supposed to be used within the company. For example, the reception section Employees, who are the end users, have access to register the customer's information or the manager can add or edit the employee's information. 

Technically, based on the role that was defined and the authority that was granted, end users may engage in activity.

## Architecture
The structure of this refactored version is built on a three-layer architecture, with each layer being responsible for its own set of tasks.
