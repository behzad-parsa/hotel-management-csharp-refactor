## Description
The first version of the hotel system was written in my college days in 2018. Recently,I decided to refactor my code in a different style and architecture, with efficient and clean code in a new repository with separate commits. The older version is available on my repo [here](https://github.com/behzad-parsa/hotel-management-csharp).

The idea is simple: we have 2 main **Actors** (customers and users) in the Database, who impact the program, and our main challenge is to manage **the flow of data** based on these actors.Â  

 - **Users** : They are the end users who are **Employees** either and register the data

 - **Customers** : They're going to be our direct clients,and they can have attendance, which is knowns as **Guests** in the Database
